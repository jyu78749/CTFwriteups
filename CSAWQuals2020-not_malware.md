This is a writeup that uses plain old static reverse engineering. No angr: even though it did speed my solve up just a little, it isn't necessary.
No dynamic analysis, mostly because I haven't learned gdb.

## Descriptive Analysis
Based on the analysis, the input string must be: `softbank:XXX:NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN:end`
Where X represents our initial settings and N is our signature
The first X is the initial seed.
The second X is how much the seed changes for each signature number.
The third X is what index from the generated long to choose.

The thing is, if the seed remains the same, the first generated number will also remain the same since the function reinitializes rand() with srand().
That means the easiest thing to do is make the second X = 0.
For my solution I ended up using 101.

## Brute Force or Quick Script
From here, you can copy out the section 4 and run it with tweaks to find the random number.
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  int v59 = 1;
  int v56 = 0;
  int v55 = 1;
  char v5[10];
  for (int j = 0; j <= 19; ++j )
  {
    srand(v59);
    long v3 = rand();
    snprintf(v5, 10uLL, "%ld", v3);
    printf ("%c\n", v5[v55]);
    v59 += v56;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Or you can just bruteforce 0-9 and see which one works.
For 101, the random number happens to be 8.

##Solution:

```
What's your credit card number (for safekeeping) ?
>> softbank:101:88888888888888888888:end
Thanks!
